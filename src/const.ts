        When the actor Ansel Elgort strolled into Times Square on Wednesday for an appearance on ”Good Morning America,” the first
        face he encountered was his own. “I’ve never seen myself so big,” he said, staring up at a bright pink billboard for
        his new movie, “Baby Driver,” which was opening that day to rapturous reviews. “Good morning, America!” Mr. Elgort’s
        latest star turn is a heist picture about a guy operating a getaway car for bank robbers, but he had sat passively
        in the back seat of an Escalade on the ride to Midtown from his home in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn.
        It had been a slow trip, more than a half-hour just to get across the Williamsburg Bridge and up to the ABC studios,
        where a small group of his devoted fans were waiting outside the stage door for him to arrive and administer hugs and
        selfies. Normally, Mr. Elgort, 23, would just have taken the C train. Or perhaps used Citi Bike. “I have an account,”
        he said. Limousines, in other words, are not his speed. Three years ago, Mr. Elgort became something of a teen idol
        when he and Shailene Woodley played terminally ill cancer patients falling in love in the movie adaptation of John
        Green’s best-selling young adult novel “The Fault in Our Stars,” which grossed $307 million at the global box office.
        Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story As with “Titanic” and “Romeo and Juliet”
        before it, the maudlin plot had an obvious appeal to anxious youngsters seeking to turn their ordinary struggles with
        first love into definitive proof of a universe conspiring against them. The fact that Mr. Elgort in real life is still
        with his high school sweetheart — Violetta Komyshan, a ballet dancer he met while still a student at Fiorello H. LaGuardia
        High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts — has not dampened the ardor of his female followers, virtual and physical.
        Mr. Elgort is their hipster ideal: a guy who looks like a model, gets paid like a movie star (more on that in a moment)
        and actually wants commitment in real life. Basically, said Tatiana Irizarry, standing outside “G.M.A.,” he is “the
        best person ever.” Ms. Irizarry’s opinion is unlikely to change after she sees “Baby Driver.” The film is a testosterone-drenched
        star vehicle promising to broaden Mr. Elgort’s appeal — it was on track to earn around $20 million in its opening weekend
        — without alienating his fan base. Fittingly, the title character, named Baby, is quickly revealed to be not a hardened
        delinquent, but a conscientious and oh-so-romantic orphan struggling to pay off a childhood debt and help his aged,
        deaf African-American foster parent build a nest egg. Baby’s got nowhere to run, to quote the Martha and the Vandellas
        classic that appears on the much-buzzed-about retro soundtrack. But he still does the Harlem Shuffle while delivering
        Starbucks coffee to the slick crime world overlord for whom he works, played with venom by Kevin Spacey. Growing up
        on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Mr. Elgort had a few more advantages than his character. His mother, Grethe Barrett
        Holby, is a former ballet dancer who founded an opera company based in Brooklyn. His father, Arthur Elgort, is a fashion
        photographer whose on-the-streets shoots for Vogue brought the magazine a kind of charmingly manicured naturalism.

I grew up in a family of refugees speaking Russian, a language that, as my teachers and classmates took pains to remind me, did not belong to me. Over time, it became almost exclusively the language of abuse???only the more perverse of Russian writers (Gogol, Bely, Kharms) could break and rearrange it into new shapes that were at odds with spoken (heard, rather) language.</div><div style=\"font-family: Arial, Verdana; font-size: 10pt; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal;\"><br></div><div><font face=\"Arial, Verdana\" size=\"2\">English, then, came as an escape, a secret code shared between me and no one???not even English speakers, at least not in the form it took through misheard lyrics, approximated words, and half-digested novels. It was a language that could write me, and not the other way.</font></div><div><font face=\"Arial, Verdana\" size=\"2\"><br></font></div><div><font face=\"Arial, Verdana\" size=\"2\">In Russian, I don?t write at all???if pressed, I will write in English and translate afterward. And when I write in English, it comes as a transcription. Who does the writing, I?m not exactly sure???I think there are a few of them, a family perhaps, some of them aren?t so great, others are getting better, but none of them is me. This is an obvious lie I?d like to keep believing.</font></div><div><font face=\"Arial, Verdana\" size=\"2\"><br></font></div><div><font face=\"Arial, Verdana\" size=\"2\"><div>Writing in English is a vanishing act?incidentally, the title of my next graphic novel (first plug of two). It?s more a sum of all I?ve read and heard, minced through residual Russianness into an awkward guise of some forgotten bastard child of, say, Joyce and Proust (although it changes daily), who, even if they had a shag (both their relative geography and timelines permit it), would not conceive anything more tangible than nagging disappointment. The aim is to stage, within the privacy of my mind, an unprecedented orgy that will chafe off last vestiges of my own voice and render me anonymous.</div><div><br></div><div>The reasons here aren?t purely artistic. In my formative years, standing out, let alone asserting one?s identity, was an open invitation to a beating (or worse). My only wish was to disappear, to seep through the days inoffensively in search of a quiet spot where I could speak and not be heard.</div><div><br></div><div>Each summer I go in search of such a place (no luck so far), often against my will and with a sense of dread???an obligation I must fill to live the words and anchor them against the fluff of vague romantic expectations. I relish the letdowns, ignore the sights, and usually plow through dreaming of home, which, in my life of endless rootlessness, is more of an unattainable dream-state than a place of present habitation.</div><div><br></div><div>At times I have a memory of a trip I didn?t take???a dream-memory???so I pack my bags and write it, and afterward, upon return, a hefty part of me would not acknowledge, not under any circumstance, that this account is fiction.</div><div><br></div><div><div>From real trips (or trips for which I have the evidence of boarding passes), I bring back only slight inexplicable clusters of words that contain within them the entire placeness of the place, condensed and heavily encrypted.</div><div><br></div><div>Chicago, for example, is a woman on the phone saying, ?All my friends are investment bankers.? As soon as I heard the phrase, I took out my notebook and wrote: All my friends are investment bankers. On the hour-long walk to my host?s apartment, past the discount grocery, the park, and Dunkin? Donuts, and all throughout my stay, I kept repeating to myself: All my friends are investment bankers. The woman on the phone would be justifiably surprised (possibly alarmed) to learn that her throwaway remark defined her city more than the Art Institute, the horrid weather, the cakes and the after-parties, all 20 endless afternoons at the residency; more even than even the empanadas, which were admittedly quite mediocre.</div></div><div><br></div><div><div>New York: A local tabloid cover showing a photograph of tangled hockey players, captioned (in caps) ?STRESS BARF.?</div><div><br></div><div>Austin: On Doing Nothing, the title of my talk and my eventual book on the artistic potential of idleness (plug two of two).</div><div><br></div><div>Bologna: A voice filling my jet-lagged room, ?Roman, you?re super-late.?</div><div><br></div><div>Paris: Gare Montparnasse; a man, dead drunk at 9 a.m., threatening to bring the sea to Paris from Marseille.</div><div><br></div><div>Moscow, meanwhile, is blank.</div></div><div><br></div><div><div>As for drawing?and I suppose I should expound on that, since it is what I?m mainly known for???drawing is translation, however loose, of all those voices and words; an attempt, futile again, to draw nothing. Nothing???not a blank.</div><div><br></div><div>Occasionally, rarely???too rarely???the image comes without a word. It has the sound of a word and is itself a word, albeit a word I can?t transcribe in written language. These drawings come fully formed and effortless, although their significance is clear only to me. To others, they don?t stand out among my other work; in fact, they?re likely to appear a bit more quarter-assed than usual, which is to me a hefty part of their appeal.</div><div><br></div><div>I?m not a natural drawer (is that a word?). I never really drew much as a child, less so as a teen, and at the start of my career, at weekly drink-and-draws, I?d mostly drink and rarely draw.</div></div><div><br></div><div><div>Therefore, when a drawing comes unplanned, unprompted, I can?t quite put it to use as a mere illustration?although I will use it as such right here (context permits). These drawings are a private pleasure?not even the drawings themselves, but the process of their creation, the -ing of drawing, which is, unlike the tortured and protracted births of all my books, like an early morning dream: forgotten on arrival.</div><div><br></div><div>I know I cannot replicate them no matter how I try, and facing such impotence before my own creation gives me a bit of hope. Somewhere inside there is a voice beyond my understanding???a voice I can?t dissect and readily identify?and so, for now, I?ll call it mine.</div></div><div><br></div><div>So, yes, it?s all rather mysterious: a series of doomed attempts to move and leave no trace, leaving each time a smaller trace, eventually (never), nothing???if not that, almost nothing, wherein the coefficient of lines and words will be the almost to my nothing.</div></font></div>",

It?s just in the air.?</font><div><font face=\"Arial, Verdana\" size=\"2\"><br></font></div><div><font face=\"Arial, Verdana\" size=\"2\">Sade?s current series is just part of the Oakland Museum of California?s newest exhibit, Respect: Hip-Hop Style and Wisdom, which opens this weekend and runs through August, her photos a hyperlocal slice of the vibrancy and expression that move through the entirety of the on-display collections. Her images capture the people and scenes of the streets of Oakland, her subjects mainly fellow Oakland creatives???musicians, photographers and artists???who pushed and inspired her in what has been only her first year behind the camera.</font></div><div><font face=\"Arial, Verdana\" size=\"2\"><br></font></div><div><font face=\"Arial, Verdana\" size=\"2\"><div>This collaborative and encouraging spirit is crucial to the world of hip-hop but an aspect that had never received a lot of attention due to much-maligned stereotypes around the genre. But it?s on full display in Respect.</div><div><br></div><div>OMCA opens its tour through hip-hop?s historical and cultural significance with the Dojo room, a highly interactive space where participants are encouraged to learn by doing, regardless of skill. Two massive video screens play popular rap and hip-hop videos in front of a microphone where you can sing or rap along. A table full of record players and beat pads encourages you to try mixing your own music or creating your own beats. A very enthusiastic series of dance videos plays along the back wall next to a small sign that reads, ?Come dance with us!?</div><div><br></div><div>Behind the Dojo, the exhibit becomes a little more somber, but not at all reserved. Guests move first through the historical context of hip-hop?s beginnings: housing inequalities, drug epidemics and the removal of educational resources, all of which hit black communities hardest in the 1970s. From that time emerged an art form meant to act as a platform for diverse groups to talk about survival, strategy, art and community.</div><div><br></div><div>?Hip-hop is vibrant and influential culturally, but socially, it provides a platform for diverse communities to come together,? says René de Guzman, the senior curator of art at the OMCA and the curator of Respect. ?We?re approaching 45 years since hip-hop was quote ?invented,? and now it?s become a central part of society?The African-American experience is now a central part of America?s history.?</div><div>The rest of the exhibit focuses on the style and wisdom of hip-hop?the ways in which it influenced other art forms and the people who produced them. This ranges from a seven-minute short documentary on Bay Area ?turf dancing? to a personal collection of streetwear jackets from Eric Robles?a.k.a. EBONE415. Especially striking in the back part of the gallery, where the ceilings stretch the highest, is a careful selection of graffiti, contributed and curated by local graffiti artists Vogue and Refa One.</div><div><br></div><div><div>?We worked closely with Vogue and Refa One to really be able to highlight graffiti as an important story, something that has history and depth,? said Scott Moulton, design director at the OMCA, noting that some of hip-hop?s most vibrant expressions happen in public. ?They selected a number of graffiti writers to create these large-scale murals [and] drew on their personal collections to build out the story of the local graffiti scene here.?</div><div><br></div><div>?This project speaks to a trajectory that the museum has been pursuing in the past few years about really taking on subject matter and content that resonates regionally, statewide and nationally, but has deep roots here in Oakland,? said Lori Fogarty, director of the OMCA, nodding to past exhibits on marijuana, the Black Panther party and Dorothea Lange. ?Obviously, hip-hop rose to the top of that list as we thought about those projects.?</div></div><div><br></div><div><div>The interactive nature of Respect makes it simultaneously impactful and accessible to both longstanding members of the local community as well as newcomers to the art form. Much like the mic-wielding leaders who have shaped hip-hop, this exhibit begs for you to get involved in whatever capacity you can.</div><div><br></div><div>?Come and have fun and pick up something,? said Sade of the exhibit?s opening this weekend. ?Just know that even from seeing my work, you can do whatever it is that you want to do. You can be in the museum next.?</div></div></font></div>",
